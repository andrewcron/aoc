    "The problem asks us to find the number of distinct paths from a starting node `you` to an ending node `out` in a directed graph. The graph is defined by a list of devices and their outputs.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Parse the Input**: Read the input file and build an adjacency list representing the graph.\n",
    "2.  **Count Paths**: Since we need to count the number of paths, and the graph is likely a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (implied by \"data... can't flow backwards\"), we can use a recursive Depth First Search (DFS) with memoization.\n",

    "        *   If `current_node == target_node`, return 1.\n",
    "        *   If `current_node` is already in our memoization table, return the stored value.\n",
    "        *   Otherwise, sum `count_paths(neighbor, target_node)` for all neighbors of `current_node`.\n",
    "        *   Store and return the sum.\n"
